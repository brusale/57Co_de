# 57Code

## Fitting
It contains ROOT macros for fitting the energy spectra from the two different detectors.

## Linearity
This directory contains the notebooks for MCA and TAC linearity.

## MC
Different scripts for a MC simulation that estimates the number of counts based on the window width we choose.
-```WindowMC.py``` we can choose how wide our window is going to be, in units of sigma
		python WindowMC.py --sigma <width>

## Plotters
Various ROOT macros that plot the energy spectra from the two detectos and also the time spectra we use to determine the half-life of 57Fe.

## Prompt
ROOT macros for the study of prompt coincidences with a 22Na source.

## Tau
ROOT macros for fitting the time spectra and measure the 57Fe metastable state half-life.
